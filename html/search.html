                    <h1 class="intro">Picasso painted <em>The Actor</em> over another painting, because he could not
                        afford new canvases at the time. He created the painting over the winter of 1904–1905, at the
                        age of 23. This was during the artist's Rose Period, when he changed his painting style from the
                        downbeat tones of his Blue Period to warmer and more romantic hues. The painting currently
                        resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was donated to the museum in 1952
                        by automobile heiress Thelma Chrysler Foy, daughter of Walter Chrysler, the founder of the
                        Chrysler automobile company. Experts estimate that the painting, which is considered to be one
                        of the biggest from Picasso's Rose Period, is worth more than US$100 million.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro"><em>Family of Saltimbanques</em> (La famille de saltimbanques) is a 1905 painting
                        by Pablo Picasso. It is considered the masterpiece of Picasso's circus period. The painting
                        depicts six saltimbanques, a kind of itinerant circus performer, in a desolate landscape. The
                        composition groups them together, but they do not seem connected to each other and are not
                        looking at each other.[</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro">By 1905 Picasso became a favorite of the American art collectors Leo and Gertrude
                        Stein. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work.
                        Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein
                        became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in
                        her informal Salon at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse,
                        who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and
                        her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and
                        Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became
                        patrons of Matisse; while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro">Inspired by ancient art he saw while in Rome, Picasso began painting heavy-set
                        figures in a neoclassical mode. In 1918, having married the Russian dancer Olga Koklova, Picasso
                        was drawn to images of mothers with children.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro"><em>The Burial</em>, one of Courbet's most important works, records the funeral of
                        his grandfather which he attended in September 1848. People who attended the funeral were the
                        models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives,
                        but in <em>Burial</em> Courbet said he "painted the very people who had been present at the
                        interment, all the townspeople". The result is a realistic presentation of them, and of life in
                        Ornans.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro">This is Paul Gaugin’s most famous painting, and he considered it his masterpiece,
                        and the culmination of his thoughts. In Tahiti, as he was painting his masterpiece, Gaugin
                        declared that he would commit suicide upon its completion. Although this was something he had
                        previously attempted, this was not the case, as the artist died of syphilis in 1903. The
                        painting was meant to be read from right to left, with the three main figures in the painting
                        representing the three questions of the title. The figures are arranged from the beginning
                        stages of life, from young figures with a child, to the middle aged figure in the middle, to the
                        elder figure on the left of the painting. The idol in the background, situated behind the elder
                        figure, represents the “Beyond.”</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro">In the later part of his life, Van Gogh committed himself to an asylum in Saint
                        Remy de Provence. <em>The Starry Night</em> was the view from the window in Van Gogh’s
                        sanitarium bedroom. Although it is a night scene, it was painted during the day. The painting is
                        often referred to as Van Gogh’s magnus opus. As he often sent his works to his brother Theo for
                        his approval, he mailed this one to him in late 1889. He also wrote that he was not so happy
                        about the work, which did not seem complete, as he had originally intended it to simply be a
                        study of the night sky.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro"><em>Wheatfield with Crows</em> is a July 1890 painting by Vincent van Gogh. It is
                        commonly but mistakenly stated that this was Van Gogh's last painting. Art historians are
                        uncertain as to which painting was Van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist, but
                        the evidence of his letters suggests that Wheatfield with Crows was completed around 10 July and
                        predates such paintings as Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890 and Daubigny's Garden.</h1>

                    <h1 class="intro"><em>The Creation of Adam</em> is arguably the most famous section of
                        Michelangelo's fresco Sistine Chapel ceiling painted circa 1511–1512. It is traditionally
                        thought to illustrate the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God
                        breathes life into Adam, the first man. Chronologically the fourth in the series of panels
                        depicting episodes from Genesis on the Sistine ceiling, it was among the last to be completed.
                        It is the most well-known of the Sistine Chapel fresco panels, and its fame as a piece of art is
                        rivaled only by the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. The image of the near-touching hands of God
                        and Adam has become one of the single most iconic images of humanity and has been reproduced in
                        countless imitations and parodies. Along with Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, The Creation
                        of Adam and the other Sistine Chapel panels are the most replicated religious paintings of all
                        time.</h1>
